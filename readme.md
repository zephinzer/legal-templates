# Legal Templates

## Overview
This repository is a collection of legal templates that have been put together for ease
of replication in projects by developers, makers and startups.

## Important Disclaimer
The templates herein are provided **AS-IS** and neither constitutes legal advice nor are
they drawn up by a legal professional and may/may not apply in your country and region.

The intention of the documents are to provide a starting point for amateur creators to
release products where such legal documents are required.

## Contributing
I use React with Next to render the legal templates. See existing templates to create
your own. Fork this repository, add your document/components and create a pull request.
